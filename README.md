Homemade DIY Phone Projector with Solar-Powered MP3 Audio Enhancement
Five years ago, I engineered this innovative DIY phone projector system designed to deliver an immersive video experience using basic optical principles and sustainable power sources.

ðŸ”§ How It Works:
At the core of the system is a 45Â°-angled plane mirror positioned inside a light-tight enclosure. This mirror reflects the image from a smartphone screen placed horizontally at the top.
The reflected image is directed onto a concave lens (acting as a magnifying lens), which then projects an enlarged version of the video onto a wall or screen in a darkened room.
The black accordion-style enclosure (constructed from folded material) helps to eliminate ambient light interference and maintain focus distance between the lens and the phone, creating a controlled projection chamber.
ðŸ”Š Audio Amplification:
A wireless MP3 speaker (yellow device in the image) pairs with the phone via Bluetooth to amplify the audio, providing a more engaging media experience. This compensates for the common issue of low phone speaker output during projection.
ðŸ”‹ Sustainable Power:
To keep the system portable and eco-friendly, a solar panel (visible in the image) is included. It powers the wireless speaker by charging it during the day, ensuring continuous use even in areas with limited access to electricity.

ðŸ§  Technical Summary:
Optics Used: Plane mirror (45Â° angle), Concave lens (for image magnification).
Audio Interface: Wireless MP3 speaker with Bluetooth support.
Power Source: Portable solar panel with USB output.
Structure: Custom light-blocking box with optimal lens-to-screen distance.
Applications: Educational use, entertainment in off-grid areas, DIY STEM projects.
This device showcases how fundamental physics (reflection and refraction) can be combined with sustainable tech to build practical, low-cost visual and audio systems. A perfect example of innovation through resourcefulness!
